Template github repo used for new Typescript based projects.

# Instructions

If this is a HMPPS project then the creation of new services is automated and cloning/forking this repository is not required.

Documentation to create new services is located [here](https://tech-docs.hmpps.service.justice.gov.uk/creating-new-services/).

This project is community managed by the mojdt `#typescript` slack channel.
Please raise any questions or queries there. Contributions welcome!

Our security policy is located [here](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/hmpps-pin-phone-ui/security/policy).

More information about the template project including features can be
found [here](https://dsdmoj.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/NDSS/pages/3488677932/Typescript+template+project).

## Running application locally

Create an environment file by copying `.env.example` -> `.env`
Environment variables set in here will be available when running `start:dev`

Ask member of team for details.

Install dependencies using `npm run setup`, ensuring you are using `node v24`

Note: Using `nvm` (or [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm)), run `nvm install --latest-npm` within the repository folder
to use the correct version of node, and the latest version of npm. This matches the `engines` config in `package.json`
and the github pipeline build config.

And then, to build the assets and start the app with esbuild:

`npm run start:dev`

### Logging in with a test user

Application uses Launchpad auth.
Running locally login can be bypassed with

    BYPASS_AUTH=true

Or an example DEV prisoner can be used if set up for Launchpad.

### Installing dependencies

By default no pre or post install scripts will be run during `npm install`.
Instead a list of configured install scripts will be run via the [npm script allowlist](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/hmpps-typescript-lib/tree/main/packages/npm-script-allowlist) tool.

Instead of running `npm install`, run `npm run setup` - this will run an `npm ci` to install any dependencies and then run any configured install scripts.

### Making changes

The [hmpps precommit hooks library](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/hmpps-typescript-lib/tree/main/packages/precommit-hooks) will ensure that [prek](https://prek.j178.dev/cli/) is installed and initialised against the repo as part of `npm run setup`.

This will run a set of precommit hooks before every commit as configured in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.
This will scan for potential secrets in the staged files and fail the commit if any are detected.

There's some guidance for dealing with false positives in the [precommit hooks docs](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/hmpps-typescript-lib/tree/main/packages/precommit-hooks#dealing-with-false-positives).

The secret scanner hook can also be configured as described [here](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/devsecops-hooks?tab=readme-ov-file#-configuration).

### Run linter

- `npm run lint` runs `eslint`.
- `npm run typecheck` runs the TypeScript compiler `tsc`.

### Run unit tests

`npm run test`

### Running integration tests

For local running, start a wiremock instance by:

`docker compose -f docker-compose-test.yml up`

Then run the server in test mode by:

`npm run start-feature` (or `npm run start-feature:dev` to run with auto-restart on changes)

After first install ensure playwright is initialised:

`npm run int-test-init:ci`

And then either, run tests in headless mode with:

`npm run int-test`

Or run tests with the UI:

`npm run int-test-ui`

## Keeping your app up-to-date

While there are multiple ways to keep your project up-to-date this [method](https://mojdt.slack.com/archives/C69NWE339/p1694009011413449) doesn't require you to keep cherry picking the changes, however if that works for you there is no reason to stop.

In your service, add the template as a remote:

`git remote add template https://github.com/ministryofjustice/hmpps-pin-phone-ui`

Create a branch and switch to it, eg:

`git checkout -b template-changes-2309`

Fetch all remotes:

`git fetch --all`

Merge the changes from the template into your service source:

`git merge template/main --allow-unrelated-histories`

You'll need to manually handle the merge of the changes, but if you do it early, carefully, and regularly, it won't be too much of a hassle.

## Change log

A changelog for the service is available [here](./CHANGELOG.md)
